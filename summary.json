  "summary": "Discussion about the IMO Grand Challenge design from 2019, focusing on the formal-to-formal variant using Lean and concerns about phrasing around 'eliminating human judges'. Daniel Selsam clarified that the competition would build on mathlib without blacklisting, and that solutions need to type-check within 10 minutes. Later in 2021, questions arose about Lean 3 vs Lean 4 for the challenge, with confirmation that mathlib is essential for IMO formalization but Lean 4 was still a work in progress.",

    "Concern raised about 'eliminating human judges' phrasing being potentially threatening to mathematicians",
    "Daniel Selsam clarified that solutions would use mathlib without blacklisting specific theorems",
    "Background math library would include theorems human competitors can cite plus basic definitions, type-checked separately from the 10-minute limit",
    "Mathlib is highly relevant for IMO problems (see archive/ directory for examples)",
    "As of 2021, Lean 4 was still work in progress and mathlib porting wasn't ready for general contribution"
